# Colosseum
Enter the Colosseum and compete for glory and riches. Complete a series of three challenges and gain rewards based on your performance. Featuring 8 different challenges, each requires teamwork or raw battle prowess to succeed. Challengers (PCs) compete against Combatants (NPCs or Opposing PC teams) for victory. This content is easily incorporated into any campaign, or used as a standalone module to try builds and party compositions. It also works well with pregenerated characters of a given level for one-off play.

## Features
### Enter the Colosseum (Beacons)
You can enter the Colosseum anywhere a beacon is located. Typically this is at major cities or hubs, but beacons can exist potentially anywhere.
:
Activating a beacon with the appropriate amount of gold, teleports you to the Colosseum and begins the first (randomly selected) challenge.

### Challenege Level (CL)
The Challenge Level (hereafter refered to as CL) is used to determine entry cost, gold reward modifier, and Encounter Sizing Guidance. The CL is chosen by the entrants, and by default is equal to the party's average level. Some challenges have a "Party Sizing" reccomendation to ensure the challenge scales to the party size.

### Cost to Enter
The cost to enter is equal to 25 GP * CL. This is a total cost paid by the group, not per individual cost. At CL 5, the entry fee is 100 GP. Your DM may choose to allow Gemstones as substitution for some or all of the gold cost. This value can be adjusted at DM discretion to balance the gold fountain provided by repeated runs.

### Challenge Points (CP)
Unless otherwise specified in the Special Rules section of a Challenege; A number of Challenge Points is awarded for completing a Challenege, according to the following table. 

##### Challege Point table
|Challenge Complete|Points Awarded|
|:---|:---|
|By end of Round 2|3|
|By end of Round 6|2|
|By end of Round 10|1|

\column

### Timed Challenges
Challenges are intended to be completed in 2-6 rounds each, with a maximum of 10 rounds. After 10 rounds the challenge ends in failure and the party exits the Colosseum. 

### Death Saving Throws
Player Characters are Immune to death while in the Colosseum. Unless otherwise specified in the Special Rules section of a challenege; A creature that is reduced to 0 Hit Points and fails three Death Saving Throws or is killed outright, despawns and is removed for the remainder of the current challenege. They respawn at 1 Hit Point prior to the beginning of the next challenge. This creature can benefit from Refreshments and Boons if available to the party.

### Initiative
Initiative is rolled after each challenge is set up and Challengers and Combatants are placed on the map. Initiative should be rolled individually for Combatants.

### Elite Challenge
When Challengers complete all three Challenges with a total CP score of 7 or higher, the Challengers unlock an optional Elite Challenge. Using "Encounter Sizing Guidance", this challenge should use the minimum number of Combatants possible.
:
Challengers do not earn Refreshments or Boons prior to an Elite Challenge.

## Moving to the next Challenge
The party adds any Gold Dice and Item rewards earned to their reward pool, random Boon options are presented, and they have the option to retire or continue. All active effects and spells end (excluding Boons) and a minimum of 1 minute passes between challenges. If a challenge is completed before the end of round 4, the party recieves Refreshments in addition to a Boon. After round 4, a Challenger must choose between earning a presented Boon or Refreshments.

### Refreshments
You may benefit from a Short Rest and can use any resources at your disposal.

### Boons
Boons are randomly selected boosts given to Challengers that they benefit from until exiting the Colosseum. Roll 1d8 for each Boon table below, and present the options to the party for each Challenger to select 1 from (3 total). Some Boons are only available until consumed (or given immediately), others can be taken multiple times (cumulative) and some can only be taken once per Colosseum. Consumed Boons do not stack. Spells cast as part of a Boon require no material components. Only 1 Boon is selected per challenge.

## Rewards
Rewards are placed into a pool when the party completes a Challenge. Rewards are granted to the party once the Colosseum is complete or the party chooses to retire after completing a challenge. If the party fails a challenge, they forfeit any item rewards gained, but still roll and earn gold rewards. Individual creatures do not drop or carry any items or gold directly.

### Experience
If you are using experience to track levels, you may award experience for each completed challenege rather than defeating creatures. The reccomended experience awarded per completed challenge is 10% of the total experience required to grant the next level (DM's discretion). For example, if the party average level is 2, you must gain 600 experience (to a total experience of 900) to gain level 3. Completing a challenge would award 60 experience. Assuming 3 challenges in a single session of play, this sets a level progression of 2-4 sessions per level. For the sake of simplicity, it is reccomended that all earned experience is gained following the conclusion of the current instance.



\column

### Gold
Each completed challenge confers a number of "Gold Dice" that represent your potential gold rewards. At the conclusion of the Colosseum, players roll their earned Gold Dice.

**Result.** The total Gold Dice roll is multiplied by the CL, and that much gold is awarded to the party.

**Example.** With a total roll of 4 at Challenge Level 5: 40 * 5 = 200 GP reward.
:
Unless otherwise specified in the Special Rules section of a Challenege; Each challenge begins with the potential of 5 Gold Dice, and at the end of each second round (2, 4, etc) the amount of Gold Dice awarded is reduced by 1. The size of Gold Die awarded is dependent on how many challenges have been completed so far in this Colosseum instance.

##### Gold Dice reward table
|Challenge Completed|Die Size Rewarded|
|:---|:---|
|1|d6|
|2|d8|
|3|d12|

### Items
Each completed challenge offers one item as a reward in addition to Gold Dice earned. Based on the CL, the rarity of the item increases. Each subsequent challenge provides the potential for a different type of item reward. See the tables below for reccomended rarities and items to be available upon completed challenges. Items available in each item pool and whether they are randomly earned or selectively given should be at DM discretion for balance purposes. Remember that items still have GP values in addition to gold rewards!

##### CL Item Rarity table
|Challenge Level|Item Rarity|
|:---|:---|
|1-2|Mundane|
|3-4|Common|
|5-8|Uncommon|
|9-12|Rare|
|13-16|Very Rare|
|17+|Legendary|

##### Challenge Item Pool
|Challenge #|Item Types in Pool|
|---|:---|
|1|Potion, Scroll, Ammunition, Consumable|
|2|Rod, Staff, Wand, Wonderous Item, Equipment|
|3|Ring, Armor, Weapon|

### Elite Challenge
Completing an Elite Challenge rewards the party with 2x muliplier on their final Gold Dice roll, and one additional item reward selected across the entire possible list of item rewards available.

## Challenges
Each challenege is determined randomly by rolling 1d8 and selecting the corresponding challenge. The same challenge cannot be chosen during the same Colosseum instance if already completed, and should be rerolled.

**Map Selection.** The style or setting is at DM's discretion. This allows the use some otherwise underutilized maps. It is encouraged to mix in maps of varying gradients and environments (such as lava caves or urban areas). Perhaps adding some hazards or obstacles makes the encounter more dynamic!

### Beelzeball 
Compete in this head to head sporting matchup that will test your Dexterity and strategy to manuever the field and score a goal!

#### Setup
On a map that is 100 feet by 65 feet, with a center line drawn perpendicular to the long sides across the midpoint. A 10 foot by 5 foot area is placed on the center of each short side, on the inside of the map. Each team begins on either side of the mid point which represents their side and their goal. Challengers and Combatants place themselves in an unoccupied space of their choice on their side of the field. 
:
At the start of the first round, the beelzeball appears on the center most point of the field. Challengers and Combatants compete for possession of the ball, and attempt to move the ball and score a goal on the opposite side of the field from their side. Successfully moving the ball into the opposing team's goal, scores a goal for your team. 
:
**Party Sizing.** The opposing team composition should use Encounter Sizing Guidance and have an equal number of combatants to challengers.

#### Objective
Be the first team to score 3 goals, or have the highest number of goals at the end of 10 rounds. If the challenge ends in a tie at the end of round 10, a Shootout occurs.
:
**Shootout.** Each challenger and combatant rolls a DC 15 Strength (Atheletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. The team with the most successes wins. On a tie, repeat this process until there is a clear winner.

#### Death Saving Throws
Creatures can't be reduced below 1 Hit Point. If damage would reduce a creature's Hit Points to 0 or less, they are instead knocked Prone, and they roll 1d20. On a roll of 1-9, they  also have the Unconscious condition until the beginning of their next turn.

## Encounter Sizing Guidance

Inspired by [various similar models](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/dtirnb/combat_encounter_cr_cheatsheet/), this uses a "Slot and Sizing" methodology. ::
:
<div style='width:50%;float:left'> 

Using the following table, add 1 "slot" for each party member. using the following tables, assign Combatants to fill all of the slots. Pay attention to "Party Sizing" reccomendations in some challenges as you may need a specific number of total Combatants. In these tables, CR refers to the standard "Challenge Rating" normally used.
</div>

<div style='width:50%;float:right'>

:

|Combatant Type|Slots Occupied|Abbreviation|
|:---|:---|:---|
|Minion|1/3|M|
|Soldier|1|S|
|Captain|2|C|
|Elite|4|E|
</div>

<div class='classTable wide' style='width:100%;float:bottom'>

![cat warrior](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IP-DND-Resources/Colosseum/refs/heads/main/img/Encounter%20Table.png) {width:100%}

</div>

#### Example 1
A party of 5 Challengers that have chosen a Challenge Level of 7, and 5 Combatants are needed. There would be 5 slots and Combatant composition would be a mix of 5x CR 2-3.
:
This is because there are 5 slots for 5 Challengers, and a CR 2-3 takes up one slot each at CL 7

<div style='width:50%;float:left'>

:

#### Example 2
A party of 4 Challengers that have chosen a Challenge Level of 9, and are doing Tug of War. There would be 4 slots and Combatant composition could be one of: 
- 1x CR 11-12
- 2x CR 5-6
- 1x CR 5 & 2x CR 3-4
- 4x CR 3-4
:
This is because there are 4 slots for 4 Challengers. A CR 11-12 takes all 4 slots, or a CR 5-6 takes 2 slots each, etc.

</div>

<div style='width:50%;float:right'>

::

#### Example 3
A party of 3 Challengers that have chosen a Challenge Level of 2, and are doing Slaughter. There would be 3 slots and Combatnat composition could be one of: 
- 1x CR 1 & 1x CR 1/2
- 3x CR 1/2
- 2x CR 1/2 & 3x CR 1/8 - 1/4
- 1x CR 1/2 & 6x CR 1/8 - 1/4
:
This is because there are 3 slots for 3 Challengers. A CR 1 takes 2 slots, a CR 1/2 takes 1 slot, and a CR 1/4 - 1/8 takes 3 to one slot.
